# Rock Paper Scissors Game â€“ AWS Static Website Hosting


This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides an interactive and visually appealing UI that allows users to play the game against the computer.

Beyond game logic, this project demonstrates end-to-end **static website deployment on AWS** â€” making it a great example of combining front-end development with cloud hosting skills.

To make the website globally accessible, the static site is hosted on **Amazon S3** with public read permissions. To enhance performance, security, and availability, **AWS CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)** is integrated, ensuring low-latency access and **HTTPS** support.

This project was completed with **zero cost** using AWS Free Tier, making it suitable for beginners learning cloud foundations.
